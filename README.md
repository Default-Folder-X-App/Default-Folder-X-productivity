## What is Default Folder X?

Default Folder X is a macOS utility that supercharges your file dialogs. It adds toolbar buttons, keyboard shortcuts, and a sidebar to Open and Save windows, making it easier to navigate, organize, and access your files.

This tool remembers where you last saved files, suggests recently used folders, and allows you to assign favorites and tags for lightning-fast navigation. It also offers advanced features like folder syncing, file filtering, and custom actions.

Ideal for users who work with multiple projects or applications daily, Default Folder X eliminates repetitive navigation and helps you focus on being productive. It works invisibly in the background, enhancing macOS without changing how you use your computer.

Whether you're a designer, writer, programmer, or administrator, Default Folder X adapts to your workflow and saves you time every day.
